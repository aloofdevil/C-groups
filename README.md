# C-Groups Memory Controller Simulator

## Overview

This project simulates an 8-core CPU connected to a multi C-group memory controller.

Each core generates memory requests that are distributed across 4 memory groups using simple address mapping logic.

The simulator models:

- CPU Controller
- Multiple CPU Cores
- Multi C-group Memory Controller
- Request handling and latency calculation
